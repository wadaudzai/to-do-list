## Built With

-- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-- Used Webpack as bundler
-- (Used Lighthouse, Webhint, Stylelint, and ESLint as linters)


## Getting Started
This project makes use of Webpack to bundle all the JS modules, and FontAwesome icons.

Clone the repository into your local machine and then run npm install to download all the dependencies. Then after making any changes inside the src/ folder, you can run npm run build to generate the corresponding files inside dist/ directory.

Run tests
If you want to test your changes on the fly without having to build every time, you can use npm run start to start the webpack-dev-server in development mode. This will watch for any changes you make and update the page accordingly.

To check the linters on your local env, make sure you have installed all dependencies (npm install) and then copy and paste the following files inside the root of the project: .hintrc, .stylelintrc.json, and .eslintrc.json.

### Prerequisites
    You only need a good computer with a browser and VS Code.
